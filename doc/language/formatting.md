# Formatting

Proze supports simple markup that you can use for formatting your story.

## Bold

Text can be formatted as bold by using a pair of `__` characters.

Example

```proze
Everything between __the double underscores__ will be shown in __bold__.
```

If you forget to include the second `__`, then the bold formatting will automatically end at the next blank line.

## Italic

Text can be formatted as italic by using a pair of `*` characters.

Example

```proze
Everything between *the asterisks* will be shown in *italic*.
```

If you forget to include the second `*`, then the italic formatting will automatically end at the next blank line.

## Em Dash

Use two contiguous hyphens `--` for an [Em Dash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dash#Em_dash).
