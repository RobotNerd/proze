# Block Quotes

Paragraphs can be treated as block quotes by using leading spaces. Do this by adding `2 spaces` before the first word of the paragraph.

It was a dark and stormy night; the rain fell in torrents—except at occasional
intervals, when it was checked by a violent gust of wind which swept up the
streets (for it is in London that our scene lies), rattling along the housetops,
and fiercely agitating the scanty flame of the lamps that struggled against the
darkness.

  Through one of the obscurest quarters of London, and among haunts little
  loved by the gentlemen of the police, a man, evidently of the lowest orders,
  was wending his solitary way. He stopped twice or thrice at different shops
  and houses of a description correspondent with the appearance of the quartier
  in which they were situated, and tended inquiry for some article or another
  which did not seem easily to be met with.

All the answers he received were couched in the negative; and as he turned from
each door he muttered to himself, in no very elegant phraseology, his
disappointment and discontent. At length, at one house, the landlord, a sturdy
butcher, after rendering the same reply the inquirer had hitherto received,
added, “But if this vill do as vell, Dummie, it is quite at your sarvice!”

In the example above the second paragraph will have larger left and right margins than the surrounding text. The beginning of the block quote is set by the first line of the paragraph and will be reset on the next blank line.

You can have multiple levels of block quotes. This is something you would use when you're quoting another document that is also quoting another doucment (e.g. something you might encounter in blog post or news article). Every additional level of block quote is defined by adding an additional `2 spaces` to the left of the first line of the paragraph.

| Block quote level | Leading spaces |
| - | - |
| None | 0 |
| 1 | 2 |
| 2 | 4 |
| 3 | 6 |

In the above example, paragraph 2 is the first-level block quote and paragraph 3 is a second-level block quote with a larger left/right margin.

In this example, paragraphs 2 and 3 will have the same margin size, representing that they're part of the same quoted document.
