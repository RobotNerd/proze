## Brackets

Special notes are placed inside a pair of brackets `[]`. When compiling
a proze project, the bracketed block of text is ignored.

- Begin with a `[`.
- End at `]` or the end of the file if no closing bracket is found.
- Whitespace must occur before the opening bracket `[` unless it is at the
  beginning of the line. There's no requirement for whitespace immediately
  before the closing bracket `]`.
- Adding a backslash as a prefix will prevent the opening/closing bracket
  from being recognized as a bracketed block.
