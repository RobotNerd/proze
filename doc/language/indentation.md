# Indentation

Paragraphs can be treated as block quotes by using indentation. Do this by adding whitespace before the first word of the paragraph.

```proze
It was a dark and stormy night; the rain fell in torrents—except at occasional intervals, when it was checked by a violent gust of wind which swept up the streets (for it is in London that our scene lies), rattling along the housetops, and fiercely agitating the scanty flame of the lamps that struggled against the darkness.

  Through one of the obscurest quarters of London, and among haunts little loved by the gentlemen of the police, a man, evidently of the lowest orders, was wending his solitary way. He stopped twice or thrice at different shops and houses of a description correspondent with the appearance of the quartier in which they were situated, and tended inquiry for some article or another which did not seem easily to be met with.

All the answers he received were couched in the negative; and as he turned from each door he muttered to himself, in no very elegant phraseology, his disappointment and discontent. At length, at one house, the landlord, a sturdy butcher, after rendering the same reply the inquirer had hitherto received, added, “But if this vill do as vell, Dummie, it is quite at your sarvice!”

In the example above the second paragraph will be indented in the output. The indentation is set by the first line of the paragraph and will be reset on the next blank line.

You can have multiple levels of indentation. This is something you would use when you're quoting another document that's also quoting another doucment (most likely encountered in blog posts and news articles).

In the above example, paragraph 2 is indented once and paragraph 3 is indented once again.

Indentation is relative. The amount of leading space is up to you. So if you want multiple paragraphs in your block quote to be indented the same amount, use the same amount of leading whitespace.

In this example, paragraphs 2 and 3 will be indented to the same level, representing that they're part of the same quoted document.
