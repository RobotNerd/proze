## Comment tokens

You can include any of these words (fully capitalized) in a comment or
a bracketed block. When there, these words will be emphasized with
syntax highlighting by proze supporting editors.

- FIXME
- IMPORTANT
- NOTE
- TODO

Use these tokens to tag notes to yourself so that you can find them
again later. For example, you can search through all of your documents
to find all instances of `TODO` with areas that you need to work on.
