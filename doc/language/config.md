## Configuration file

Each proze project can optionally include a configuration file specific to
that project. It is located in the project root (see
[Folder structure](#folder-structure)). The following formats are supported:
- json
- yaml

The configuration file is named `config.json` or `config.yml` depending
on the file format (e.g. `config.json` or `config.yml`).

The configuration file can contain:
- project compilation configuration
- special names used in the project

Available configuration options are detailed in the subsections below.
