# Configuration file

Each proze project can optionally include a configuration file specific to the project. It is located in the project root (see [Folder structure](./files.md#folder-structure)). Both JSON and YAML file formats are supported. The configuration file is named `config.json` or `config.yml` depending on the file format.

The configuration file contains settings for:
- Special names used in the proze project (.e.g character names).
- The order in which proze files should be compiled into the final document.
- Settings to pass to the compiler.
