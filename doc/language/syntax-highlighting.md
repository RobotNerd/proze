## Syntax highlighting

Text editors that support proze should provide syntax highlighting. This is
one of the key benefits of using proze, since syntax highlighting provides
visual feedback to a writer about the structure of the document.

The following elements should be uniquely highlighted:
- Bracketed blocks
- Comments
- Comment tokens
- Dialogue
- Italicized and bolded text
- Special names
- Metadata tags
