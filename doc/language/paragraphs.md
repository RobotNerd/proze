# Paragraphs

The content of a document is contained in paragraphs. Write the content of your story in paragraphs just like you would in any other document or editor.

```proze
It was a dark and stormy night; the rain fell in torrentsâ€”except at occasional intervals, when it was checked by a violent gust of wind which swept up the streets (for it is in London that our scene lies), rattling along the housetops, and fiercely agitating the scanty flame of the lamps that struggled against the darkness.

Through one of the obscurest quarters of London, and among haunts little loved by the gentlemen of the police, a man, evidently of the lowest orders, was wending his solitary way. He stopped twice or thrice at different shops and houses of a description correspondent with the appearance of the quartier in which they were situated, and tended inquiry for some article or another which did not seem easily to be met with.

As you can see in the above example, there is a blank line separating them. You can have more than one empty line between paragraphs. If you don't have an empty line, then everything will be lumped together in a single paragraph Another important thing to note is that there is no space before the first word of each paragraph. If there is space before the first word, it will change the margins of that paragraph in the output (see [Block Quotes](./block-quotes.md)).
