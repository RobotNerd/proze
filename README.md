# What is proze?

> TL;DR `proze` is a set of tools that lets you write literature like you write code.

Have you ever written a short story, a novel, or an essay and thought to yourself,
"I wish this had syntax highlighting like when I write code."
Well, wait no more! Proze brings the features of writing software to
writing stories.

How does it work?
- Write your story in plain text using the proze format.
- Use a supported text editor to get syntax highlighting.
- Compile your project into a target format (PDF, Word doc, etc).
- Profit!

## Where do I get started?

The easist path is to go through the [tutorial](./doc/tutorial.md). It walks you
through every step of setting up proze to compiling a project for publishing.

If you're interested in developing your own compiler or editor plugin for proze,
read through the [technical specification](./doc/technical-specification.md).
There you'll find the gritty details of the proze format.

## Using the compiler

Read the [compiler instructions](./doc/compiler.md);

## Supported editors

These editors have plugins that support syntax highlighting proze.
