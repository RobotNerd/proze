# What is proze?

> TL;DR proze is a document format that makes writing prose a little more

Have you ever written a short story, a novel, or an essay and thought to yourself,
"I wish this had syntax highlighting like what I get when writing code."
Well, wait no more! Proze is a format designed to bring some of the features used
by programmers when writing software so that they can be used when writing stories.

How do I use it?
- Write your story in plain text files following the proze format.
- Use a supported text editor to get syntax highlighting.
- Compile your project into a target format (PDF, Word doc, etc).
- Profit!
